# Preston's Personal User Manual (PUM)

## My Style

- I love to try out new ways of doing things
- I dislike making generalizations about myself (stuff like "oh, I am just such a logical, methodical person"), and for that reason, this "Manual" was very difficult for me to write. So if you want to compliment me, say something about something I did or have, not about who I am. 
- I want to work with people that have something in common with me. At least something small that we can relate to. 
- I want to teach others while I am with them. I want them to have learned something new. 

## My Values

- I do not do inappropriate humor. 
- I am a firm believer that anything and everything can be fun! 
- All 

## When to Approach Me

- For businessy things: Any day except Sunday
- Other than that, any time I guess
- I am most approachable when there is food

## How Best to Communicate With Me

- I like it when people just say the truth, even if it is difficult to hear. 

## How I Make Decisions

- I usually try to compare the pros and cons of everything. Before making decisions, I always like to be informed. I make no ipmortant decisions without doing some research. 

## What People Misunderstand About Me

- People might think that I sometimes get prideful and overconfident/show-offy, while the reality is that it is my biggest fear to have people think that about me. 
- I am not naturally extroverted. In many social situations (like parties), I can become extremely closed off. 
- If I brush off a compliment, that is most likely because I don't know how to respond to it (see also point 2 of [My Style](#my-style))

## How to Help Me

- I usually don't know the basics of things but know more advanced stuff better. Thus, I am usually confused in classroom settings.
