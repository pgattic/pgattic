# pgattic

Hello! I am pgattic! I like to write simple games 👨‍💻, do gymnastics 🤸, and play the guitar 🎸! But not all at the same time! 😉

I am an Eagle Scout, a former competitive gymnast, and a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I graduated from the International Academy of Macomb in 2020, and I am currently attending BYU-Idaho, going into computer science.

I am from Detroit, Michigan, currently residing in Rexburg, Idaho.

I know how to code in JavaScript and know a bit about other languages but I am overall kind of a beginner haha.
