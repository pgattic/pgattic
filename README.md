In addition to the programming languages shown above, I am well-versed in utilities like Linux and Git.

I am an Eagle Scout, a former competitive gymnast, and a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I graduated from the International Academy of Macomb in 2020, served a full-time mission for my church in El Salvador from 2020 to 2022, and I am currently attending BYU-Idaho, majoring in Computer Science.
