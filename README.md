# Hello!

I am Preston Corless! I code for fun! 

I am proficient in the HTML5 suite (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) and Python, and also have experience in asssembly language for the 6502 processor. I am well-versed in utilities like Linux and Git. 

I am an Eagle Scout, a former competitive gymnast, and a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. I graduated from the International Academy of Macomb in 2020, served a full-time mission for my church in El Salvador from 2020 to 2022, and I am currently attending BYU-Idaho, majoring in Software Engineering.
